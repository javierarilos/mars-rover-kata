# Mars Rover Kata (Java)

## Goal
Practice Outside-In / Classicist TDD and familiarize with common code smells, refactoring steps, design patterns and principles

## Description
Develop an api that moves a rover around on a grid.

* You are given the initial starting point (x, y) of a rover and the direction (North, South, East, West) it is facing.
* The rover receives a list of commands.
* Implement commands that move the rover forward / backward.
* Implement commands that turn the rover left / right.
* Make sure rover doesn't move if it receives an unknown command

## Implementation
Recommended approach to solve this kata is by using TDD.
